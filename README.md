# FreeCodeCamp Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the code exercises for two freeCodeCamp certifications:

- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)
- [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different section of the certifications, and within each folder, you'll find the code for the relevant exercises.

## How to Use

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or resource if you're working on these certifications or trying to improve your coding skills. However, I recommend that you try to solve the exercises on your own before consulting my solutions.

## Feedback

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
